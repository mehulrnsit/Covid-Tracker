# The home page shows the US Current Covid Stats

 Click on the states option in the navbar to get metadata of all the states

 For details information about a particular state you can click on the state to fetch details

 All the data has been fetched by using https://covidtracking.com/data/api

 You can use https://covid-track-us.herokuapp.com/ to see the Web Application, deployed using heroku

 I have used EJS templating to render multiple pages and used node.js for the backen.
